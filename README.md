# AWS-Cloud-Journey
My journey with AWS has been an amazing experience. It started when I was a kid and I developed an interest in technology. From that time on, I was interested in exploring how technology could benefit us.

I have always been curious about how Amazon AWS works and what it can do. I started learning AWS a few months back and have learned more than I ever thought possible. I have been working on projects using AWS Cloud services using Python.

I have created a GitHub repository that contains all the projects that I worked on and would like to share it with you all!

The projects are in the form of Sprints. Each Sprint is an extension of the previous sprint. This is a journey of making a web health crawler and deploying it into a pipeline. Each sprint is a milestone in the whole journey. 

I hope you can take something out of it !!
