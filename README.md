# AWS-Cloud-Journey
My journey with AWS has been an amazing experience. It started when I was a kid and I developed an interest in technology. From that time on, I was interested in exploring how technology could benefit us.

I have always been curious about how Amazon AWS works and what it can do. I started learning AWS a few months back and have learned more than I ever thought possible. I have been working on projects using AWS Cloud services using Python.

I have created a GitHub repository that contains all the projects that I worked on and would like to share it with you all!

I hope you can take something out of it!
